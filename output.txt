(november 2012) (learn how and when to remove this template message) although originally charged with guarding india's external boundaries, the bsf has more recently been given the task in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations in jammu and kashmir, punjab, north east. while in punjab bsf took part in operation like blue star, black thunder 1 & 2 till 1989 and when the insurgency in jammu and kashmir broke out in 1989, the bsf handover the counter insurgency operations to crpf and punjab police and moved towards state of jammu & kashmir. in jammu and kashmir state police and the thinly-deployed central reserve police force (crpf) struggled to cope up with the spiraling violence, and the indian government deployed the bsf to jammu and kashmir to combat separatist militants. the bsf initially suffered casualties from insurgent attacks but later saw successes, including the arrest of militant leaders, after setting up an intelligence network and working with local civilians. bsf contribution in reducing militancy in j&k is widely acknowledged. the bsf killed ghazi baba?chief of jaish-e-mohammed and the mastermind of the 2001 indian parliament attack?in august 2003 along with his deputy commander. the bsf raided baba's hideout in srinagar and he was killed in the ensuing gun battle along with his deputy chief. despite the bsf's success in a counter-terrorism role, many in the government felt that this additional burden was leading to a dilution of the bsf's mandate and degrading the force's ability to perform its primary role of guarding the country's borders. in 2006 the indian government has decided to implement recommendations to restrict each security agency to its mandate. thus the 16 bsf battalions in jammu and kashmir are gradually being withdrawn from counter-insurgency duties and diverted back to guard the indo-pak border. they are being replaced by fresh units from the crpf that have undergone specialised training in counter-terrorism. but the crpf is yet to take over sensitive places like tral. the 16 battalions being withdrawn from j&k were supposed to provide r&r to the battalions already deployed on the border. but with increasing naxal violence in central india, government decided to diversify the anti-naxal operation with the induction of itbp and bsf. bsf was deployed in kanker district of chhattisgarh, where naxal strength is comparatively thinner than that of other parts of bastar region. at present total 15 battalions of bsf are stationed in different parts of kanker district to combat naxal menace. organisation this section does not cite any sources. please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. unsourced material may be challenged and removed.

"creek crocodiles are trained to thwart any evil designs from across the border", bsf commandant pushpendra singh rathore, who had created and trained the commando unit at koteshwar outpost of bsf, said. "we have kept three things in mind while selecting cadets for the commando including swimming and marine diving performance, firing abilities and endurance to work in the rough creek,".[citation needed] the crocodile units have 42 commandos at present[when?] and they are undergoing vigorous training, he said. mine protected vehicles according to the senior bsf officer, some mpvs have already been introduced in a number of bsf units along the border and more mpvs to be added in the coming years.[22] planning and development [icon] this section is empty. you can help by adding to it. (january 2013) facing difficulty in guarding riverine sections of indo-pak border, the bsf has started installing farheen laser walls to fill the gaps which saw several breach by militants from across the border.[23] criticism and controversy condemnation by canada in 2010, some canadian visa officials rejected the immigration application of a retired bsf soldier fateh singh pandher, terming bsf a "notoriously violent paramilitary unit engaged in systematic attacks on civilians and responsible for torturing suspected criminals". this accusation did not go down well with the indian government. the indian external affairs ministry was asked by the home minister to take up the issue with canada.[24][25] the home ministry of india, as well as the indian public in general and several of india's political parties, expressed outrage at this attack and called canada's actions discriminatory and spurious, and their charges against the bsf as baseless and unproven. the indian government threatened diplomatic retaliation unless canada withdrew their allegations. the canadian government did not respond immediately.[26] it was speculated that diplomatic retaliation from india will consist of banning canadians going to participate the war in afghanistan if they are doing so through india. public outrage in india prompted canadian authorities to express "great respect for india's armed forces and related institutions".[27] subsequently, india's ministry of external affairs summoned canadian high commissioner joseph caron and demanded that "the blatant discrimination against indian security agencies" cease.[28] india's minister of external affairs, sm krishna, condemned canada's actions and has expressed pride in the accomplishments of the bsf.[29] following complaints made by the indian government and criticism of canada's actions against india, the harper government retracted their earlier accusations against bsf security officials. canada's minister of citizenship and immigration, jason kenney, termed as "unfortunate" the incidents involving use of "foul language by the canadian high commission in visa rejection letters to some individuals", kenney said, "this language, or the inaccurate impression it has created, in no way reflects the policy or position of the government of canada."[30] controversy bangladesh border killings according to the bangladeshi government, 136 civilians were killed and a further 170 others suffered injuries in 2009. the indian government has said that 67 were killed and 80 injured in 2009.[31] the bangladesh government and bangladeshi organizations protested heavily against these alleged killings. media reports claim that in august 2008, indian bsf officials admitted that they killed 59 persons (34 bangladeshis, 21 indians, rest unidentified) who were trying to cross the border illegally during the prior six months.[32] indian media claimed that, in 2001, bangladeshi border force kidnapped and murdered 16 bsf personnel because they chased some bangladeshi goons back to bangladesh. since then, the bsf has been compelled to act tough against bangladeshi illegals[33] in july 2009 channel 4 news reported that apparently "hundreds" of bangladeshis and indians are indiscriminately killed by the bsf along the indo-bangladeshi barrier. the bsf claims that the barrier's main purpose is to check illegal immigration to india, and prevent cross-border terrorism from islamists.[34] bangladeshi media accused the bsf of abducting 5 bangladeshi children, aged between 8 and 15, from the haripur upazila in thakurgaon district of bangladesh, in 2010. the children were setting fishing nets near the border.[35] in 2010, human rights watch (hrw) issued an 81-page report which alleged "over 900 of abuses by the bsf" in the first decade of the 21st century. the report was compiled from interviews with victims of bsf shootings, witnesses and members of the bsf and its bangladeshi counterpart. according to hrw, while most of them were killed when they crossed into indian territory for indulging in cattle raiding or other smuggling activities.[36] in february 2012, the bsf website was hacked by bangladeshi hackers in retaliation. the hackers later shared the news in the internet and also in the other social sites where they claimed to have defaced the sites asking the bsf to stop killing bangladeshis at border. the site became normal sometime on 15 february 2012.[37][38][39][40] see also assam rifles border security force (water wing) central industrial security force central reserve police force indo-tibetan border police sashastra seema bal references "border security force". archived from the original on 24 december 2014. retrieved 10 december 2014.
